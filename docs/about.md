# About

This project is a collection of utilities for manipulating years, and it uses a lot of [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s project under the hood.

You can use it with [webpack 2](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) or [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and benefit from their tree-shaking feature.
